# Project is died finally...

### ***Important Notice***. Until I find and assemble a proper team of developers (at least 5 people), I will never in my life take on such projects, of this kind and nature. Simplify anything here already impossible. I'm fed up with it all and I'm not able anymore, problem after problem, one worse and more complicated than another. I am no longer able to solve everything alone.
