## If you have issues‚Ä¶

### ASAN AddressSanitizer issues‚Ä¶

  From NVIDIA‚Ä¶

  ```
   Because this is an AddressSanitizer error, can you confirm the crash does not repro when run without ASAN? By default ASAN does not intercept GlobalAlloc, which leads to false positives. Because our driver uses GlobalAlloc and GlobalFree you need to set this in the environment:

  ASAN_OPTIONS=windows_hook_legacy_allocators=true

  You can read more about this runtime option here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/sanitizers/asan-runtime?view=msvc-170#msvc-specific-addresssanitizer-runtime-options
  ```
